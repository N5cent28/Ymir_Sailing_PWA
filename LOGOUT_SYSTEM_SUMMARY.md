# Logout System Implementation - Ymir Sailing Club

## Problem Solved

**Multi-User Device Issue**: When multiple people use the same computer/device, they would continue receiving push notifications for each other's boat reservations after logging out, because the push subscriptions and service workers weren't properly cleaned up.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Logout Functionality
- **Complete Cleanup**: Logout now properly removes push subscriptions and unregisters service workers
- **Database Cleanup**: Removes push subscription from server database
- **UI Updates**: Logout button appears/disappears based on login status
- **Multi-language Support**: Logout button text in both English and Icelandic

### 2. Push Subscription Management
- **Automatic Unsubscription**: Removes device from push notification list
- **Server Cleanup**: Deletes subscription from database via API
- **Service Worker Cleanup**: Completely unregisters service workers

### 3. User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear logout button with logout icon
- **Confirmation**: Success message after logout
- **Automatic Redirect**: Returns to home page after logout
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile

## How It Works

### When User Logs Out:
1. **Unsubscribe from Push**: Removes device from notification system
2. **Server Cleanup**: Deletes subscription from database
3. **Service Worker Cleanup**: Unregisters all service workers
4. **Session Clear**: Removes user data from localStorage
5. **UI Update**: Hides logout button, shows login options
6. **Redirect**: Takes user back to home page

### When User Logs In:
1. **New Subscription**: Creates fresh push subscription for this device
2. **Service Worker**: Registers new service worker
3. **Database Link**: Links subscription to user's member number
4. **UI Update**: Shows logout button and user-specific features

## Files Modified

1. **`/src/lib/auth.js`** - Enhanced logout with cleanup functionality
2. **`/src/pages/api/push-subscription.js`** - Added DELETE method for subscription removal
3. **`/src/components/Navigation.astro`** - Added logout buttons and functionality

## Multi-User Device Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Family Computer
- **User A** logs in → Gets notifications for their boats
- **User A** logs out → All subscriptions cleaned up
- **User B** logs in → Gets fresh notifications for their boats only
- **No Cross-Contamination**: Each user only gets their own notifications

### Scenario 2: Shared Phone
- **User A** uses PWA on phone → Subscribed to their notifications
- **User A** logs out → Phone unsubscribed from all notifications
- **User B** logs in → Phone subscribed to User B's notifications only

### Scenario 3: Multiple Devices
- **User A** on phone + computer → Gets notifications on both
- **User A** logs out on computer → Computer stops getting notifications
- **Phone still works**: Phone continues getting notifications until User A logs out there too

## Technical Details

### Push Subscription Cleanup
```javascript
// Unsubscribe from push notifications
await subscription.unsubscribe();

// Remove from server database
await fetch('/api/push-subscription', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  body: JSON.stringify({ endpoint: subscription.endpoint })
});

// Unregister service workers
const registrations = await navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations();
for (const registration of registrations) {
  await registration.unregister();
}
```

### Database Changes
- **DELETE Method**: Added to `/api/push-subscription` endpoint
- **Cleanup Function**: `deletePushSubscription()` in database module
- **Automatic Removal**: Subscriptions removed when users log out

## User Interface

### Desktop Navigation
- **Logout Button**: Red logout icon with "Logout" text
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows when user is logged in
- **Hover Effect**: Red color on hover for clear action indication

### Mobile Navigation
- **Mobile Logout**: Same functionality in mobile menu
- **Full Width**: Takes full width in mobile menu for easy tapping
- **Consistent Design**: Matches desktop logout button styling

## Benefits

1. **Privacy**: Users don't receive each other's notifications
2. **Clean Slate**: Each login starts fresh with no old subscriptions
3. **Security**: Prevents notification leakage between users
4. **User Control**: Clear logout option for users
5. **Multi-Device Support**: Works across all devices and browsers

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Login → Logout → Login**: Verify clean state between sessions
2. **Multiple Users**: Test with different users on same device
3. **Multiple Devices**: Test logout on one device, login on another
4. **Notification Verification**: Ensure only current user gets notifications

### Expected Behavior
- **After Logout**: No more push notifications for that device
- **After Login**: Fresh push subscription for new user
- **UI Updates**: Logout button appears/disappears correctly
- **Clean Database**: Old subscriptions removed from server

This implementation ensures that your PWA works correctly in multi-user environments while maintaining the convenience of push notifications for individual users.
