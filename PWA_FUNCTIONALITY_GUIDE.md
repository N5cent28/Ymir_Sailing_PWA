## Overview

The Ymir Sailing Club PWA (Progressive Web App) is a comprehensive digital solution for managing a sailing club's boat rental and member management system. Built with modern web technologies, it provides both web and mobile app experiences through a single codebase.

### Key Capabilities
- **Boat Management**: Real-time tracking of boat availability, maintenance status, and usage
- **Member Management**: Complete member database with authentication and profile management
- **Check-in/Check-out System**: Digital boat rental process with QR code integration
- **Notification System**: Push notifications for boat reminders and club communications
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive management interface for club administrators
- **Multi-language Support**: English and Icelandic language support
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices with offline capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Framework: Astro
The application uses **Astro**, a modern static site generator that provides:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Pages are rendered on the server for better performance
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable UI components for maintainability
- **Zero-JavaScript by Default**: Only loads JavaScript when needed, improving performance
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Can integrate React, Vue, or Svelte components if needed

### Backend: Netlify Functions
The backend uses **Netlify Functions**, which are serverless functions that:
- **Auto-Scale**: Automatically handle traffic spikes without server management
- **Event-Driven**: Execute code in response to HTTP requests
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for actual usage
- **Global Distribution**: Deploy to multiple regions for low latency

### Database: PostgreSQL (Neon)
The application uses **PostgreSQL** hosted on **Neon**:
- **Relational Database**: Structured data storage with relationships between entities
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity and consistency
- **Scalability**: Can handle growing amounts of data and users
- **Cloud-Hosted**: Managed database service with automatic backups

### Key Technical Concepts Explained

#### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Instead of loading a blank page and then filling it with content using JavaScript, SSR generates the complete HTML on the server before sending it to the browser. This means:
- **Faster Initial Load**: Users see content immediately
- **Better SEO**: Search engines can easily read the content
- **Improved Performance**: Less JavaScript needs to be downloaded and executed

#### Progressive Web App (PWA)
A PWA is a web application that behaves like a native mobile app:
- **Installable**: Users can "install" it on their home screen
- **Offline Capable**: Works even without internet connection
- **Push Notifications**: Can send notifications like native apps
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

#### Serverless Functions
Instead of running a traditional server 24/7, serverless functions:
- **Execute on Demand**: Only run when called
- **Auto-Scale**: Automatically handle multiple requests
- **No Server Management**: Cloud provider handles infrastructure
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for execution time

## Core Features

### 1. Boat Management System

#### Real-Time Boat Status Tracking
The system tracks each boat's current status:
- **Operational**: Available for use
- **Checked Out**: Currently in use by a member
- **Maintenance**: Under repair or maintenance
- **Out of Service**: Temporarily unavailable

#### Boat Types
- **Individual Boats**: One user at a time (Quest, Zest, Topaz, Laser)
- **Shared Boats**: Multiple users can use simultaneously (Kayak, Paddle Board)

#### Technical Implementation
```javascript
// Example: Checking boat availability
const boatStatus = await getBoatStatus(boatId);
if (boatStatus.status === 'operational') {
  // Boat is available for checkout
}
```

### 2. Member Management

#### Member Database
Each member has:
- **Unique Member Number**: Primary identifier
- **Personal Information**: Name, phone, email
- **Authentication**: PIN-based login system
- **Admin Privileges**: Some members can access admin features
- **Sailing History**: Track of all boat usage

#### Member Authentication
The system uses a simple PIN-based authentication:
- **No Passwords**: Members use their member number and PIN
- **Session Management**: Maintains login state across page refreshes
- **Security**: PINs are hashed before storage in the database

### 3. Check-in/Check-out System

#### Digital Boat Rental Process
1. **Member Login**: Member enters their number and PIN
2. **Boat Selection**: Choose from available boats
3. **QR Code Scan**: Scan QR code on the boat for instant checkout
4. **Time Tracking**: System records departure and expected return times
5. **Check-in**: Member returns boat and checks it back in

#### QR Code Integration
Each boat has a unique QR code that:
- **Directs to Checkout Page**: QR code contains boat-specific URL
- **Pre-fills Information**: Automatically selects the correct boat
- **Mobile Optimized**: Works seamlessly on mobile devices

### 4. Real-Time Notifications

#### Push Notification System
The app can send notifications for:
- **Boat Reminders**: Notify when return time is approaching
- **Overdue Alerts**: Alert when boats are overdue
- **Maintenance Updates**: Notify about boat status changes
- **Club Communications**: General announcements

#### Technical Implementation
- **Service Worker**: Background script that handles notifications
- **VAPID Keys**: Secure method for sending push notifications
- **Browser APIs**: Uses Web Push API for cross-platform notifications

## Database Design

### Core Tables

#### Members Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE members (
  member_number TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  pin TEXT,
  is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Boats Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE boats (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'operational',
  boat_type TEXT DEFAULT 'individual',
  last_maintenance TIMESTAMP,
  notes TEXT
);
```

#### Check-ins Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE check_ins (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  boat_id TEXT REFERENCES boats(id),
  sailor_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  member_number TEXT REFERENCES members(member_number),
  departure_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  expected_return TIMESTAMP,
  actual_return TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Database Relationships
- **One-to-Many**: One member can have many check-ins
- **One-to-Many**: One boat can have many check-ins
- **Foreign Keys**: Ensure data integrity between related tables
- **Indexes**: Optimize query performance for frequently accessed data
