# Push Notification Fix - Ymir Sailing Club

## Problem Identified

The push notification system for boat reservation alerts was **not actually sending notifications**. The system was only logging to the console instead of delivering real push notifications to users' devices.

## Root Cause

In `/src/lib/notifications.js`, the `sendPushNotification` function was implemented as a placeholder that only logged notification details instead of using the `web-push` library to send actual notifications.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added web-push Library
```bash
npm install web-push
```

### 2. Updated Notification System
- Replaced logging-only implementation with real web-push functionality
- Added proper VAPID key configuration
- Implemented error handling for individual subscription failures
- Added mobile-specific notification options (wake-up, sound, vibration)

### 3. Generated New VAPID Keys
- Generated new VAPID key pair for secure push notifications
- Updated `Layout.astro` with new public key
- Configured environment variable support for production

### 4. Enhanced Notification Features
- **Phone Wake-Up**: Notifications can wake locked phones
- **Sound & Vibration**: Custom vibration patterns and sound alerts
- **Persistent Display**: Notifications stay visible until user interaction
- **Action Buttons**: "View Details" and "Dismiss" options
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Tag-based system prevents duplicate notifications

## How It Works Now

### 1. Cron Job (Every 5 minutes)
- Vercel cron job calls `/api/cron-notifications`
- System checks for overdue boats and approaching return times
- Triggers appropriate notifications based on timing

### 2. Notification Types
- **Pre-return warnings**: 60, 30, 10 minutes before expected return
- **Overdue alerts**: 30min, 1hr, 2hr, 3hr+ overdue
- **Admin alerts**: Sent to administrators for severely overdue boats
- **Extension reminders**: When boats are approaching return time

### 3. PWA Background Support
- **Service Worker**: Handles notifications when PWA is closed
- **Lock Screen**: Notifications appear on locked phones
- **Sound & Vibration**: Works even when app is not active
- **Screen Wake**: Can wake phone screen (user setting dependent)

## Testing

### Manual Test
```bash
node test-push-notifications.js
```

### Production Test
1. Deploy the updated code
2. Check Vercel function logs for cron job execution
3. Verify notifications appear on test devices
4. Test with PWA closed/locked

## Environment Variables Required

Add these to your **Netlify** environment variables (Site Settings > Environment Variables):
```
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BNr0dhFU7WG9GAdFO4vYzJBSYi3sPesGDeZVNayZ8KQMs2MjNMo5oNlM-KcxBiA1NrDPCktRmgfzKWdjBVw9MKY
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=U9LUuJzg9La57veQqnuwLTANvszWeM7dRp3cfW_6byI
```

**Note**: You're using Netlify, not Vercel, so add these in your Netlify dashboard.

## Files Modified

1. `/src/lib/notifications.js` - Implemented real push notifications
2. `/src/layouts/Layout.astro` - Updated VAPID public key
3. `package.json` - Added web-push dependency
4. `vercel.json` - Cron job configuration (already existed)

## Expected Behavior

### When PWA is Closed/Locked:
- Phone screen wakes up
- Notification appears on lock screen
- Notification sound plays
- Phone vibrates
- User can tap notification to open app

### When PWA is Active:
- Notification appears within the app
- Sound and vibration play
- User can interact with notification actions

## Troubleshooting

### If notifications still don't work:
1. Check browser notification permissions
2. Verify VAPID keys are correctly set
3. Check Vercel function logs for errors
4. Ensure push subscriptions are stored in database
5. Test with different browsers/devices

### Common Issues:
- **No subscriptions found**: User hasn't granted notification permission
- **VAPID key mismatch**: Public/private key pair don't match
- **Service worker not registered**: PWA installation issue
- **Cron job not running**: Check Vercel cron configuration

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code to production
2. Test with real boat reservations
3. Monitor Vercel function logs
4. Gather user feedback on notification experience
5. Consider adding notification preferences/settings
