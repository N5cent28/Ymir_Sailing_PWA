# Ymir Sailing Club PWA - Feature Summary

## Overview
The Ymir Sailing Club Progressive Web App (PWA) is a bilingual (English/Icelandic) boat management system that allows sailors to check boats in and out using QR codes, with real-time tracking and notifications.

## Core Boat Check-In/Out System

### QR Code System
- **Static QR Codes**: Each boat has a unique, permanent QR code
- **Boat Fleet**: 5 boats entered for now
  - Quest 1, Quest 2
  - Zest 1, Zest 2, Zest 3
- **QR Code URLs**: `https://yourdomain.com/qr/boat-1` through `boat-5`
- **Print & Attach**: QR codes can be printed and physically attached to boats

### Check-Out Process (Boat Departure)
1. **Sailor scans QR code** with phone camera
2. **Check-out form appears** with boat status and information
3. **Required fields**:
   - Sailor name
   - Phone number
   - Expected return time
4. **Optional fields**:
   - Member number (auto-fills name/phone if registered)
5. **Validation**:
   - Checks if boat is available/maintenance/out of service
   - Prevents check-out if boat is unavailable
6. **Database recording**: Creates check-in record with departure time

### Check-In Process (Boat Return)
1. **Sailor scans same QR code** or visits admin page
2. **Easy check-in button appears** if there's an active check-in for the boat
3. **Sailor clicks "Check In Now"** button (no need to scan QR code again)
4. **Alternative: Remote check-in** - Sailors can visit "My Boat" page and enter member number
5. **System records** actual return time
6. **Boat status updated** to available
7. **Push notification sent** confirming successful return

### Remote Check-In Feature
