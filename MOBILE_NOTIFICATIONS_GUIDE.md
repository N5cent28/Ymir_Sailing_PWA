# Mobile Push Notifications Guide - Ymir Sailing Club

## üì± How Mobile Notifications Work

### **Phone Wake-Up & Sound Behavior**

Push notifications are designed to work even when the PWA is not active or the phone is locked. Here's how they work:

#### **‚úÖ When PWA is Closed/Locked:**
- **Background Processing**: Browser service worker handles notifications
- **System Integration**: Phone OS receives notification from browser
- **Screen Wake**: Notifications can wake the phone screen (user setting dependent)
- **Lock Screen Display**: Notifications appear on lock screen
- **Sound & Vibration**: Plays notification sound and vibrates

#### **‚úÖ When PWA is Active:**
- **In-App Notifications**: Shows notification within the app
- **Background Notifications**: Still works when app is in background
- **Sound & Vibration**: Plays notification sound and vibrates

### **üîä Sound & Vibration Features**

#### **Enhanced Notification Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  vibrate: [200, 100, 200, 100, 200], // More noticeable vibration pattern
  requireInteraction: true,            // Keeps notification visible until user interacts
  silent: false,                       // Ensures sound plays
  tag: 'notification-type',            // Prevents duplicate notifications
  renotify: true,                      // Allows re-notification with same tag
  timestamp: Date.now()                // Notification timestamp
}
```

#### **Mobile-Specific Features:**
- **Vibration Patterns**: Custom vibration sequences for different notification types
- **Sound Override**: Notifications can override "Do Not Disturb" (high priority)
- **Persistent Display**: Notifications stay visible until user interacts
- **Action Buttons**: "View Details" and "Dismiss" buttons on notifications

### **üì≤ User Experience**

#### **What Users Will Experience:**

1. **Phone Locked/App Closed:**
   - Phone screen wakes up
   - Notification appears on lock screen
   - Notification sound plays
   - Phone vibrates
   - User can tap notification to open app

   - Sound and vibration play
   - User can tap to bring app to foreground

3. **App Active:**

### **‚öôÔ∏è User Settings That Affect Notifications**

#### **Browser Settings:**

### **üîß Technical Implementation**

#### **Service Worker Configuration:**
```javascript
// Enhanced mobile wake-up and sound configuration
const options = {
  vibrate: [200, 100, 200, 100, 200], // More noticeable vibration
  requireInteraction: true,            // Keeps notification visible
  silent: false,                       // Ensures sound plays
  tag: 'notification-type',            // Prevents duplicates
  renotify: true,                      // Allows re-notification
  timestamp: Date.now()                // Notification timestamp
};
```

#### **Push Notification Payload:**
```javascript
{
  title: "Notification Title",
  body: "Notification message",
  icon: "/icon-192.svg",
  badge: "/icon-192.svg",
  data: {
    type: 'boat_reminder',
    memberNumber: '1234',
    action: 'view_boat'
  },
